This is a database of the measurement of different lengths in the 1st and 2nd phalanx of populations of Sus scrofa (wild boars) in SouthWest and East Asia, from the article written by Zeder, M & Lemoine, X (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jas.2020.105115). The measurements taken are those of greatest length (GL), greatest breadth of proximal end (GBPE) and smallest breadth of diaphysis (SBD), the population was also divided by sex (Male/Female) and site location in either Turkey, Iran or Iraq. The data was collected to look at the levels of sexual dimorphism of this species in the area of South West and East Asia and has great importance since this species of pigs were domesticated and of great use in the area. The main use of this dataset in its original research is to create a demographicÂ profile.
